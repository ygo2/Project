We are developing CommUnity, an interactive application to strengthen connections between newcomers and established community members who can share knowledge and support. Specifically, we will start with students on Calvin’s campus, where communities include specific dorms, KE apartment buildings, and possibly classes and student organizations. The app allows people within these communities to collaborate, offer support, and share meaningful knowledge about campus life and beyond through a Q+A forum.

This app will stand out from competitors such as Reddit, Discord, and Slack by being locally subdivided and built for mobile. It will focus on organizing more social and less technical information while providing three key features: posting information, asking questions, and searching previous posts. Ultimately, our project aims to utilize Calvin University’s rich culture as a foundation for building inclusive spaces, regardless of background, and to enhance belonging while strengthening relationships across the locations we serve.
